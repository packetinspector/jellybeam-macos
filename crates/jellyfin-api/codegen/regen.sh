#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Regenerates ../src/models.rs from the Jellyfin OpenAPI spec.
#
# Usage:
#   ./regen.sh              # regenerate curated-subset models from the
#                            # already-checked-in, hash-verified spec file
#   ./regen.sh --full        # generate ALL schemas instead of the curated subset
#   ./regen.sh --update-pin  # deliberately refresh the pinned spec file from
#                            # PINNED_SPEC_URL; does NOT regenerate models.rs
#                            # by itself -- see the printed instructions
#
# Requires: python3, rustfmt, cargo-typify (cargo install cargo-typify --locked)
#
# Uses cargo-typify against the pinned OpenAPI spec. additionalProperties:false
# is stripped so unknown fields from server drift deserialize instead of
# failing, and client methods stay hand-written rather than generated.
#
# --- Spec pinning policy ---------------------------------------------------
#
# jellyfin-openapi-stable.json is a CHECKED-IN ARTIFACT, not something this
# script silently re-downloads on every run. Re-fetching on every run would
# have two problems:
#
#   1. Every run (no flags) re-fetched "stable" from api.jellyfin.org, which
#      is a *floating* alias -- whatever the Jellyfin project currently
#      calls stable, today possibly newer than the spec version this crate
#      was actually validated against. A plain `./regen.sh` could silently
#      regenerate models.rs against a different spec than last time, with
#      no record of what changed or why.
#   2. There is no per-server-version spec URL upstream (api.jellyfin.org/openapi/
#      only publishes
#      jellyfin-openapi-{stable,unstable}[_previous].json -- no
#      jellyfin-openapi-10.11.10.json-style artifact, and the jellyfin/jellyfin
#      GitHub releases don't attach an openapi.json asset per tag either).
#      So "pin to the exact spec version matching the dev server" isn't
#      literally possible via URL; what IS possible, and what this script
#      now does, is pin to an exact CONTENT HASH of a spec snapshot chosen
#      deliberately, and never move off it silently.
#
# The current pin (12.0.0) is newer than the dev server's pinned Jellyfin image
# (10.11.10, see dev/docker-compose.yml) -- newer spec, older server. That is
# a deliberate, known choice, not drift: 12.0.0's schemas deserialize
# 10.11.10's actual responses fine in the live contract tests (extra spec
# fields are all optional; the #[serde(other)] fallback covers any enum
# value the older server sends that a newer spec renamed/added since). See
# ../codegen/DRIFT.md for the full policy and how drift gets caught.
#
# Deliberate re-pin flow:
#   1. Run `./regen.sh --update-pin`. It downloads PINNED_SPEC_URL, backs up
#      the old spec file, overwrites jellyfin-openapi-stable.json, and
#      prints the new file's sha256.
#   2. Edit PINNED_SPEC_SHA256 below to that printed value (and bump the
#      version note in the comment above it).
#   3. Run `./regen.sh` normally, review the models.rs diff, commit the new
#      spec file + PINNED_SPEC_SHA256 edit + regenerated models.rs together.
# A plain `./regen.sh` with a stale PINNED_SPEC_SHA256 (spec file edited or
# swapped without updating the pin) fails loudly instead of proceeding.
