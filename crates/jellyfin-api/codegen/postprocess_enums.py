"""Post-process cargo-typify's generated `models.rs`: append a
`#[serde(other)]` catch-all `Unknown` variant to every unit-variant,
Deserialize-deriving enum.

Why: the Jellyfin OpenAPI spec models
every string enum (BaseItemKind, MediaStreamType, VideoRangeType, ...) as a
closed set. typify honors that literally: an enum tag the client doesn't
recognize (a newer server version added a BaseItemKind variant, a plugin
introduced a custom one, etc.) fails deserialization of that *one* field
with serde's default externally-tagged behavior -- and because these enums
are almost always embedded in `BaseItemDto`/`ItemsResult`, one drifted
field currently fails the whole page, not just that item.

The fix has to happen at the Rust level, not the schema level: dropping the
`enum` constraint in extract_subset.py (turning it into a plain `string`)
would lose the typed variants entirely, which is strictly worse than an
`Unknown` fallback. So this script runs *after* cargo-typify and rewrites
its output:

  1. For every `pub enum Name { ... }` block whose variants are all
     unit-like (name-only, optionally `#[serde(rename = "...")]`'d) and
     whose derive list includes both `serde::Deserialize` and
     `serde::Serialize`, append:

         #[serde(other)]
         Unrecognized,

     `#[serde(other)]` makes serde fall back to this variant instead of
     erroring when the wire value doesn't match any known tag. It also
     works for `Serialize` (an `Unrecognized` value serializes back out as
     the literal string `"Unrecognized"`, which is fine -- we only ever
     construct it by deserializing, never by hand).

     The sentinel is named `Unrecognized`, not `Unknown`, because 7 of the
     41 enums (CollectionType, ExtraType, MediaType, PersonKind,
     TranscodeReason, VideoRange, VideoRangeType) already have a
     spec-defined variant literally called `Unknown` with its own meaning
     (e.g. "collection type not set") -- reusing that name for "this build
     doesn't recognize the wire value at all" would collide with, and be
     semantically different from, the real spec value. Using one
     consistent sentinel name across all 41 enums (rather than `Unknown`
     for 34 of them and something else for the other 7) keeps the pattern
     uniform for callers.

  2. Enums typify considers "path-safe" also get a hand-written
     `impl Display` with an exhaustive `match *self { ... }` over every
     variant. Adding a variant to the enum without updating that match
     would fail to compile, so this script also appends a
     `Self::Unrecognized => f.write_str("Unrecognized"),` arm to the
     matching `impl ::std::fmt::Display for Name` block, keyed by enum
     name. `FromStr`/`TryFrom` impls are left untouched: they already end
     in a wildcard `_ => Err(...)` arm, so they still compile, and there's
     no requirement that the string `"Unrecognized"` round-trips back
     through `FromStr` (nothing in this crate parses enum values from
     user-supplied strings).

Idempotent: an enum that already has an `Unrecognized` variant (e.g.
because regen.sh was re-run without a clean typify pass) is left alone.

Any enum this script *can't* safely handle (non-unit variants, e.g. a
future spec change turning some enum into a tuple/struct variant carrier)
is skipped and reported at the end -- never mutated blindly. `regen.sh`
treats a non-empty skip list as a hard failure (see its sanity check) so
schema-shape drift here is surfaced instead of silently leaving an enum
without a fallback.
